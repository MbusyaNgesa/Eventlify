# Eventlify
Eventlify is an app that is aimed at creating a simple way for normal users to 
be easily informed about their favourite upcoming events.

This will be different from your normal event apps since  a user after subscription will
be informed directly to the different genres of choice.

Users will receive direct messages to their phones informing them of the event that they 
subscribed to be it Jazz, Rock or Reggae.

This will be a game changer to the industry and everything in general.

Not only will this be a web app but also a mobile app. It will be fun and interactive to use 
and navigate. More features can/will be added after great consideration by the team in regards 
to functionality, efficiency and top demand by our customer base.
